 This [was] the project's Main class before I tossed all of this into a separate file
 To start off I'll be integrating git
 Then I'll work on the main logic and tinker with it a bunch to [[try]] and optimise it
 Then finally add some nice [programmer art] GUI that I'll try to account for early on
 If you see this I've probably turned the project in before the GUI is fully implemented
 ...And I only have myself to blame, but oh well
 It will be done soon, here's to hoping it will be before the 30th

 The main idea of this project is to work as a "fixation tracker" for myself
 Basically a program that lets the user set a timer with a note saying something akin to
 "Practice drawing in X style" or "Watch two seasons of X show"
 Small silly things like that the timer is supposed to give some minor time pressure
 meant to promote actually doing the things as opposed to putting them off indefinitely
 [kinda like this project, whoops]
 This way whatever I'm fixating on is actually touched and not allowed to slip my mind forever

 As for the particulars:
 - The program is meant to let the user set multiple timers
 - The timers are picked from presets labelled with "Wood Types"
   [ex. oak = 6 hours, maple = 1 day]
 - The notes are picked from presets labelled with "Kindling Types"
   [ex. pine resin kindling = 200 character plaintext note, pine cone = 5 bullet points note]
 - Once a timer has started, the user may add an "additive" to the "fire" [active timer]
   [ex. cinnamon stick = +1 checklist bullet point added to note, dry rosemary = +6 hours timer]
 - The timer will be based on the stored time of starting and the system clock for simplicity
 - Once the timer runs out, the user may choose one of two options
    - Archiving the timer, saving the note, when it started and ended + all additive info
    - Saving the timer as template, letting the user quickly restart it at any time
 - The GUI is meant to dynamically show the timers as campfires of varying appearances
   so some flags will need to be set up for handling states such as "how much of the timer
   has passed" or "which additives were added and how many", as those would affect the fire
   [timer's] appearance. Though the actual art is a bit of a "stretch goal" at the moment
